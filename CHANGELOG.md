# Changelog

All notable changes to Hermit CRM. Versions follow semantic versioning; a change to
the data format always comes with an automatic migration.

## 0.2.0 (unreleased)

Data format 3: `result` on interactions is folded into `outcome` by an
automatic migration.

- One `outcome` per interaction, chosen from a dropdown whose values come from
  `config.toml` (`outcomes`, default successful/unsuccessful; first = what a
  detected reply counts as, last = what silence counts as). The Messages tab
  and the interaction form write the same field, so a change on one shows on
  the other. Migration 3 merges the old `result` and normalises legacy
  spellings (front matter only).
- Messages: an expanded row shows the full text only, not preview and text.
- Interactions can be deleted (edit page and company timeline; confirm first).
- New contact from the Contacts page: type the company, an existing one is
  matched by name or email domain, otherwise it is created; possible
  duplicates (same email, same name at the company, similar company name)
  are shown first with "create anyway".
- Companies and Contacts pages carry their own New and Import buttons; the
  top nav is Pipeline · Calendar · Companies · Contacts · Messages · Reports ·
  Settings.
- Settings (`/settings`, replaces Setup): you, BCC capture, calendar, backup,
  enrichment provider, outcomes, the review queue (formerly Inbox), schedule
  status and version. `/setup` and `/inbox` redirect there.
- Reports: every number links to the rows behind it (`/reports/rows`).
- Help: `/help/<topic>` on every page (link in the nav) and `hermitcrm help
  <topic>` in the terminal, from Markdown shipped in the package; written to
  be read by people and AI agents alike.
- Merge: the picker offers the existing companies/contacts.
- Enrich works under launchd/systemd again: the CLI is looked up in
  /usr/local/bin, /opt/homebrew/bin and ~/.local/bin when PATH is bare, and
  `schedule install` sets PATH in the job.
- docs/LEARNINGS.md and TODO.md.

## 0.1.0 (2026-09-15)

First public release, by Gijs Bos.

- Guided setup: `hermitcrm init` asks three questions (you, BCC capture, backup;
  `--no-setup` skips them), `hermitcrm setup` reruns them, and the web app has a
  Setup page (`/setup`, CSRF-protected) that first-run redirects to once. An
  empty Board offers Import, Add a company and Set up BCC capture.
- `hermitcrm schedule install [--at HH:MM] [--serve]`, `remove` and `status`:
  a daily `sync --apply` via launchd (macOS) or systemd user units (Linux);
  Windows gets the `schtasks` command to run.
- `hermitcrm doctor [--online]`: one ok/warn/fail line per check (Python, git,
  data folder, migrations, config, secrets, IMAP login, calendar, schedule,
  git remote and last push, enrich CLI, updates); exits 1 on a failure.
- A CRM that is a folder of Markdown files with YAML front matter in git; every
  write is one commit.
- `hermitcrm init DIR [--demo]`: a data folder with a commented `config.toml`,
  agent rules (`CLAUDE.md` / `AGENTS.md`), a `MESSAGING.md` starter and optional
  demo data; `hermitcrm [--data DIR]` or `HERMITCRM_DATA` to point at it.
- Local web app (`hermitcrm serve`): pipeline board, companies and contacts tables
  with filters, calendar of next steps, company timelines, merge, Messages tab,
  Reports (activity, funnel, outcomes, messages, hygiene).
- Deterministic outreach drafts in English, German, Dutch and French, with the
  wording in `default_messages.toml` and an optional `messages.toml` override.
- BCC import over Gmail IMAP and calendar import from a secret ICS feed, with an
  Inbox for unmatched items.
- Import from CSV, TSV and `.xlsx`; enrichment from a URL or any AI CLI.
- Secrets from `HERMITCRM_*` environment variables, `.secrets.toml` or the macOS
  Keychain.
- Data format versions with automatic, one-commit migrations
  (`hermitcrm migrate --dry-run`); unknown front-matter keys are preserved.
- Any ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 country; `UK`/`USA` are stored as `GB`/`US`.
- `hermitcrm --version`, version in the footer, and a daily non-blocking update check.
